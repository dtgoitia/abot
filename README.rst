This project is focused on giving a proper interface for bot creation. Although for now it is just focused on
dubtrack, there is a full asyncio slack API implementation, just need to make the bridge.

In this repo there is also a bot implemented (mosbot) that will need to go once I am confident enough of the interface
the library provides.
